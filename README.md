# Exploring-Personal-Weight-Loss
Personal Weight Loss Exploratory Data Analysis and an attempt to create a machine learning model using said data to predict weight gain or loss. 

## About The Project
This project takes a look at my weight gain/loss data starting November 2019 up to the end of March 2021. We use Exploratory Data Analysis techniques to establish key insights about the data and use these to create a predictive model using Support Vector Regression and Support Vector Machines. Please see the attached Project documentation for full details.
